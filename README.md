# Weak Heap Sort

The files in this repository document a fully functional formalization of weak heaps
and the resulting weak heap sort algorithm first studied by R.D. Dutton (93).

Details can be found in the file `Weak_Heap.thy`.

## Installation

The theories were developed in Isabelle2020/HOL.
The proofs relating weak heaps to braun trees require the [archive of formal proofs to be set up](https://www.isa-afp.org/using.html).
